# Weblog
This application is a weblog (blog) application. The intention of this project is to be a "live" project that can be used for coding practice, much like katas.  Hopefully having a live project with a broader scope will allow the owner to:
* Practice multiple aspects of software development (i.e. data objects, storage repositories, UI, unit tests, integration tests, etc.).
* Have working code that can be used to test software upgrades or migrations.
* Practice breaking work into small, deployable chunks.
* Experience software deployment and maintenance in a prod-like environment.

# To Do
1. Design data model and repository.
1. Design URL endpoints.
1. Create POST endpoint to create a blog entry.
1. Create GET endpoint to create a blog entry.
1. UI Spike.
  1. Determine technology to use (probably Angular, but worth looking at Vue.js).
  1. Lay out Post creation UI.
  1. Lay out Post viewing UI.
1. Create Post creation UI.
1. Create Post viewing UI.

# Future Considerations
